# Simple Ethereum Wallet
A simple wallet, developed as a university-project, to be used with a local Ganache network.
Disclaimer: Using this on an actual Ethereum network, transfering real ETH, is completely your own responsibility.
The wallet is written in Vue.js

For it to work, there must be a local Ganache network running. Change the port value to fit that of the Ganache 
instance in the client.js file. (currently set to the default)

Ganache: https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache
