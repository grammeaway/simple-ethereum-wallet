# Simple Ethereum Wallet
A simple wallet, developed as a university-project, to be used with a local Ganache network.

The wallet is written in Vue.js

For it to work, there must be a local Ganache network running. Change the port value to fit that of the Ganache 
instance in the client.js file. (currently set to the default)

Ganache: https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

## Disclaimer
This was developed as a simple university project. Using this on an actual Ethereum network, transfering real ETH, is completely your own responsibility. 
If something doesn't work as expected, and you lose actual data or Etheruem of value, I can not be held accountable.
